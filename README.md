A little tool to make prototyping on a solderless breadboard a little easier. Most cheap breadboard power supplies need a lot of space and dont offer modern connections. This one has a USB-C connector as input, is as slim as possible so it can be placed basically anywhere on the breadboard and it has a 1A 3.3V voltage regulator included that allows to put 3.3V on a rail. 

The project includes all production files to get the SMT parts assembled by JLCPCB (not a sponsor) but I used hand-solder-footprints for the smaller parts so it should be quite easy to solder manually, too.
